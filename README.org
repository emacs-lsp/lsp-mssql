#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-load-path ".../lsp-mssql/")
  (require 'lsp-mssql)
  (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook 'lsp)
#+END_SRC
** Configuration
   Confgure the connections.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   Open a =*.sql= file and do =M-x lsp=. On the first run, it will ask you
   whether to install the language server. Then when you are in the =sql= buffer
   do =M-x lsp-mssql-connect= which will ask you to select connection. After the
   connection is established the current buffer will be associated with the SQL
   Server and the completion and the query exection will be performed against
   that server.

   =lsp-mssql= also supports Azure MSSQL.  To connect using Service
   Principals, you need to supply =:authenticationType=:

          :server "SERVER-NAME.database.windows.net"
          :database "DATABASE-NAME"
          ;; Service Principal goes to :user
          :user "fc38d296-4aab-44b4-b74d-609b0de8e9cb"
          :password "PASSWORD"
